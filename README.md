DistributedFileSystem is a Rust-based project aimed at creating a robust and reliable distributed file system. This repository serves as the core infrastructure, providing an entry point for initializing the system, managing the server and client components, and processing commands through efficient routing. The project is designed to ensure seamless file storage and retrieval across a distributed network, enhancing data accessibility and fault tolerance. Ideal for both learning and building scalable, distributed applications, this framework lays the groundwork for a comprehensive distributed file system solution.
